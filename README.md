 currently loose association of tools for making labels & other materials for organizing.

This has 3 targeted printer types: a regular printer for sheets, a Zebra label printer, and a POS-code receipt printer. Soon this will be more of a cohesive library to be used in my kitchen organizing app instead of just a loose coallescence of tools.
